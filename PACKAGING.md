We're working with the community to get this project packaged for as many
platforms as possible.  To that end, We've created this file to help organise
resources.

If you'd like to package the toolkit for your favourite distro, or if you've
already started, please add your name/GitHub below with a pull request so we
don't have people wasting time doubling up on work rather than collaborating.


## OpenBSD

* [Florian Obser](https://github.com/fobser)

### Status

During the Bucharest hackathon, Florian hacked out a package it's already
[in the ports tree](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/net/py-ripe.atlas.tools/).


## FreeBSD

* [Max Stucchi](https://github.com/stucchimax)

### Status

Max set aside an hour and has built the few required ports to support Magellan
they are awaiting approval for inclusion into the ports tree.


## Gentoo

* [Daniel Quinn](https://github.com/danielquinn)

### Status

Daniel has created [a working overlay](https://github.com/danielquinn/ripe-atlas-overlay)
and has created an issue in [Gentoo's Bugzilla](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566818)
to have the relevant ebuilds added to the Portage tree.  If you're a Gentoo
dev that can expedite the process, or a user that would like to see this
happen faster, please direct your efforts to the bug in question.  Until then
you can always just use Daniel's overlay right from GitHub.


## Other Platforms

We've been talking with members of the community about expanding the package
support for Magellan, but so far no one has officially volunteered. The RIPE
Atlas team is happy to assist anyone interested in porting this toolkit to any
platform, but we're especially keen on at least getting into:

* Debian
* Ubuntu
* Red Hat
* Fedora
* CentOS
* Arch
* FreeBSD

If you'd like to try your hand, or would simply like to offer some advice, feel
free to add your name here or contact us directly via *atlas at ripe dot net*.
