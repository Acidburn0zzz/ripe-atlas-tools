==========

The Official command-line client for RIPE Atlas


Installation
------------

You don't.  At least, not yet.  The plan is to make it installable via
Python's package manager (`pip`) at first, and then move onto more
end-user-friendly tools like `apt`, `rpm`, and `emerge`.


How Does it Work?
-----------------

Well, it doesn't yet.  But when it's ready, you'll be able to create
measurements quickly and easily from the command line, *and* get a text-friendly
report as a response.


Can I Contribute?
-----------------

Absolutely.  Pull requests are welcome, but give us a little time to get the
architecture settled first.
