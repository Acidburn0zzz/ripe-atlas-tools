Why This Exists
===============

[RIPE Atlas](https://atlas.ripe.net) is a powerful Internet measurements
platform that until recently was only accessible via the website and the RESTful
API. The reality however is that a great many people using RIPE Atlas are most
comfortable on the command-line, so this project is an attempt to fill that gap.
